## 📝 Version Changelog

### v1.0.0
- ChatGPT and Gemini now use dedicated light palettes for a more native visual feel on each site
- Gemini panel and item backgrounds are now clearly layered for better visual separation
- Spacing behavior between panel and chat content is now more consistent while reading
- Clicking Hide now reliably shows the restore button without requiring a page refresh
- The restore button stays fixed on the right edge, supports vertical drag, and remembers position

### v0.5.3
- Fixed an issue where Gemini prompt bubble highlighting could fail after jump navigation
- Highlight feedback now appears after scrolling settles for a smoother locating experience
- In minimal mode, when space is too tight, the preview can temporarily overlap chat content to keep details readable

### v0.5.2
- In minimal mode, hover previews now expand in a way that avoids covering the main chat content whenever possible
- Added a minimum preview width so details stay readable on smaller windows
- Click feedback now briefly deepens the user prompt bubble background, then smoothly restores it

### v0.5.1

- Kept display behavior consistent across different language settings

### v0.5.0

- Theme auto-follow now works smoothly on both ChatGPT and Gemini

- Faster and more stable theme sync when the site appearance changes

### v0.4.0
- Navigator now switches to compact mode when space is tight to reduce overlap
- Panel can return to normal mode automatically after window size recovers
- Fixed flickering while continuously resizing the browser window

## 💡 Core Value

- **Less scrolling, more thinking**: Turn long threads into a structured outline and reduce search friction
- **Jump to context instantly**: Click any entry to smoothly return to the exact spot in the conversation
- **Low-interruption workflow**: Right-side floating UI with hide/restore and position memory

## ✨ Core Features

### 🎯 Intelligent Navigation System
- **Auto-detect User Prompts**: Analyzes conversation flow in real-time, extracts all user messages, and generates navigable entries in order
- **Smooth Jump Experience**: Click any entry and the page automatically scrolls to the target, then briefly deepens the prompt bubble background for easier locating
- **Real-time Content Sync**: Supports SPA route changes and dynamic content loading; navigation list updates automatically without manual refresh

### 📱 Flexible Display Modes

#### Normal Mode (Default)
- Complete display of user prompt content (truncated to two lines, ellipsis for overflow)
- Simultaneous display of AI reply preview (single line with ellipsis)
- Card-style design for entries, visually friendly and information-rich

#### Minimal Mode (Ultra-minimalist)
- Panel displays only numbered dot buttons for extreme space efficiency
- Preview expands on hover or keyboard focus, maintaining visual simplicity
- Same jump and locating capabilities with zero feature loss

#### Adaptive Mode Switching (Automatic)
- Switches mode based on geometric overlap between panel left edge and conversation content right edge
- Automatically returns to normal mode when enough layout space is available again (including Gemini pages)
- Uses a stable baseline + hysteresis during continuous window resizing to prevent flicker
- Mode button remains clickable in adaptive minimal state, but normal mode is blocked if it would overlap content

### 🎮 Interaction Design
- **Draggable Floating Button**: Right-side circular FAB button stays fixed to the right edge and supports vertical drag only
- **Position Memory**: Automatically saves button position and restores it on next visit
- **Keyboard Friendly**: Complete keyboard navigation support with proper focus management
- **Accessibility Support**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` system setting, providing non-transition experience for sensitive users
- **Automatic Theme Adaptation**: Navigator colors follow site light/dark theme automatically (ChatGPT/Gemini)
